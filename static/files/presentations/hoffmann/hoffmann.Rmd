<br>
>How do these **shape human behavior** and environmental and economic **outcomes**?

<br>
I think about:

- Incentives (and unintended consequences)

- Markets

- Institutions

- Endogeneity and Scaleability

# The prompt

### How can _emerging data and technology_ help actors in the small-scale fishery and aquaculture sectors equitably _improve their livelihoods and sustainably manage_ their resources?

# My take

###1. Access to markets and credit

###2. (Re)Designing institutions

# 1 - Access to markets & credit: Takeaways

.footnote[Clark & Munro, 1975, _JEEM_; Noack et al. 2020, _Working paper_]

- SSFA actors are ahead of us

--

- Digital platforms provide:

  - Access to markets
  
  - Financial history
  
  - Access to credit

--

- Are institutions ready?

--

  - **Weak institutions** + capital or credit = **Over-harvesting**
  
--
  
  - **Strong institutions** + capital or credit = **Under-harvesting**
