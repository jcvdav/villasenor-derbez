> Technology and data are not a replacement of management

# A common thread

I think about:

- Incentives

- Institutions

- Markets

- Endogeneity and Scalability

#Current uses of technology

- How are they using it?

    - Cost-reduction
    
    - Value increasing

- What benefits do they perceive?

- What trends do we observe?

- Given observed trends, what sectors are most ripe for assimilation?

- What are the clear needs?
