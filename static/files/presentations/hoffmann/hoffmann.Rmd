>New ways to "sense" and "measure" **shape human behavior** and environmental and economic **outcomes**

I think about:

- Incentives (and unintended consequences)

- Markets

- Institutions

- Endogeneity and Scalability

# The prompt

### How can _emerging data and technology_ help actors in the small-scale fishery and aquaculture sectors equitably _improve their livelihoods and sustainably manage_ their resources?

---
class:inverse,middle
# My take

###1. Access to markets (livelihoods)

###2. New institutions (management)
