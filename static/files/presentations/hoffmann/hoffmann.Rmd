# Outline

- How I think about environmental problems and solutions

--

- My take on the prompt:

--

  - Access to markets & credit

--

  - Sustainable intensification
  
--

  - New institutions


---
# My approach

.center[.large[**Design and evaluation** of policy interventions and technology adoptions in the marine realm]]


--

How do these **shape human behavior** and environmental and economic **outcomes**?

--

I think about:

- Markets

- Endogeneity and Scalability

- Institutions

- Incentives (and unintended consequences)

### How can _emerging data and technology_ help actors in the small-scale fishery and aquaculture sectors equitably _improve their livelihoods and sustainably manage_ their resources?

- Vessel tracking allowed vessel-day scheme

- Real-time monitoring of catch:

  - Improved data = improved fisheries management
  
  - Reduction in IUU
