# Outline

- Background:

--

  - My motivations
  
  - How I think about environmental problems and solutions
  
  - Example: Recent technological adoption in the Caribbean

--

- My take on the prompt:

--

  - **Access to markets & credit**

--

  - Other pathways

---
# Background

.center[.large[**Design and evaluation** of policy interventions and technology adoptions in the marine realm]]


--

How do these **shape human behavior** and environmental and economic **outcomes**?

--

I think about:

- Markets

- Endogeneity and Scalability

- Incentives (and unintended consequences)

- Institutions

---
class:inverse,center,middle
# Why might these matter?

--

> The same _"intervention"_ can have vastly different outcomes, depending on institutional setting

--

> Self-selection confounds effect

--

> Technology and data are not a replacement of management

---
# Example: Technological addoption in the Caribbean
