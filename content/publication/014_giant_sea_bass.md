# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "Co-operation in the management of shared fish stocks is often necessary to achieve sustainability and reduce uncertainty. The United States of America (USA) and Mexico share a number of fish stocks and marine ecosystems, while there is some binational co-operation in scientific research, unilateral management decisions are generally the rule. We present a case study using the giant sea bass (Stereolepis gigas, Polyprionidae) to highlight how these management and research asymmetries can skew national perceptions of population status for a fully transboundary species. Scientific publications and annual funding related to giant sea bass are 7x and 25x higher in the USA, respectively, despite the fact that 73% of the species’ range occurs in Mexico. Conversely, annual fishery production and consumptive value of giant sea bass in Mexico are 19x and 3.5x higher than in the USA, respectively, while the non-consumptive value related to dive ecotourism is 76x higher in the USA. These asymmetries have generated a distorted view of the population status of the giant sea bass across its entire range. This and other factors related to historical fishery dynamics and policy must be accounted for when assessing population status, and subsequent appropriate management responses, across geopolitical boundaries."
abstract_short = "We present a case study of asymetries in management using the giant sea bass (_Stereolepis gigas_, Polyprionidae) to highlight how these management and research asymmetries can skew national perceptions of population status for a fully transboundary species. We find large asymetries in the number of scientific publications and annual funding related to giant sea bass; annual fishery production and consumptive value; and visual records. These asymmetries have generated a distorted view of the population status of the giant sea bass across its entire range."
