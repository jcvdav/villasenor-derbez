# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "Pomacanthids and Pomacentrids are mainly distributed in tropical and subtropical regions, and inhabit shallow rocky and coral reefs. Due to their colorful patterns and unusual body shapes, they have been widely targeted by aquarium fish trade; these species are of great commercial interest. Here we document the occurrence of one Pomacanthid (*Holacanthus clarionensis*), and two Pomacentrids (*Stegastes acapulcoensis*, and *S. leucorus*) north of their reported distribution range during the 2014 warm water period in the eastern Tropical Eastern Pacific. Sightings took place at Magdalena-Almejas Bay complex, located in the western margin of the Baja California Peninsula. Using a series of abiotic data for the Tropical Eastern Pacific, we created a maximum entropy model for each species and identified that high probability of occurrence at Magdalena-Almejas Bay complex was only denoted for *S. leucorus*. Here we report the occurrence of *H. clarionensis*, *S. acapulcoensis* and *S. leucorus* 70 km, 300 km, and 300 km north of the northernmost reported limits."
