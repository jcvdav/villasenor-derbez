# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "Since 2011 the Kelp Forests Ecology Group (scientists and students from the IIO and FCM at Universidad Autónoma de Baja California) have traveled more than 500 km of Baja California’s Pacific coastline, exploring and documenting the peninsular’s kelp forest species. To date, 22 different sites have been visited, with over 150 dives undertaken (a total of 439 survey transects). This represents the most serious effort to set up a long-term monitoring project that will help scientists understand the dynamics of Baja’s kelp forest communities that are exposed to natural as well as anthropogenic disturbances."
