abstract = "Data collected during annual surveys (2010-2014; no data for 2013 due to a hurricane) shows that grouper and bass abundances within the MR reached 114 fish counted, 1.58 times higher than in non-protected areas. This, along with larger-sized organisms, accounts for the MR having a biomass of 0.88 T/hectare; 1.4 times higher than fished sites."
