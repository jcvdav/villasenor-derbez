# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "Global tuna fisheries are valued at more than $40 billion, with the majority of this value derived from purse seine fisheries. Recently created large-scale marine protected areas are potentially big enough to protect highly migratory species such as tuna, possibly leading to increases in abundance (a conservation benefit) and consequent spillover near protected area boundaries (an economic benefit). Using publicly available data from nine large-scale marine protected areas across the Pacific and Indian oceans, we find that catch-per-unit-effort in tuna purse seine fisheries has increased by an average of 12 to 18% near protected area boundaries, and this increase declines with distance from the boundaries. The increase is larger for bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) than for skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis), in line with fisheries science simulation models."
abstract_short = "Marine protected areas (MPAs) have been repeatedly shown to protect species within their boundaries. This is even true for wide-ranging migratory species such as tunas. Another claimed benefit of MPAs, however, is a “spillover” of fish into areas open for fishing. Whether this occurs for migratory fishes has been an open question given their movement across regions. Lynham et al. show that even for highly mobile species, specifically economically important tunas in the Pacific and Indian oceans, there is a spillover benefit of MPAs. Such results clearly underline that MPAs are essential for protecting both species and fisheries. "
