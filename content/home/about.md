# About me

I am a Ph.D. Student working with [Steve Gaines](http://gaineslab.msi.ucsb.edu/) and [Christopher Costello](https://christopherjcostello.com/) at the [Bren School of Environmental Science & Management](bren.ucsb.edu) in UC, Santa Barbara. As a [Latin American Fisheries Fellow](http://www.laff.bren.ucsb.edu) and [UC MEXUS - CONACyT](https://ucmexus.ucr.edu/), I work in Quantitative Marine Conservation. My research combines Ecological and Economic theory with Data Science. I believe today's available technology can allow us to revolutionize the way in which we manage fisheries and do conservation. 

I have always felt passionate about the Ocean. Growing up in Playa del Carmen (Mexico) I spent a lot of time in the water. I have been a SCUBA diver since I was 10 years old, and a fisher for as long as I can remember. Aside from my work, I enjoy SCUBA diving, fishing, and sailing. Following what seems to be a tradition in my family, I enjoy cooking a blend of Mexican and Spanish dishes for my close ones.

Along with [Camila Vargas](https://www.laff.bren.ucsb.edu/laff-network/camila-vargas) I run [ERRE](https://www.erre-esp.org/), a blog about all things R and RStudio in Spanish.
