# Hi there!

I am a Postdoctoral scholar with the Micheli Lab at Stanford, where I study coupled human-ocean systems, with an emphasis on the design and evaluation of policy interventions that seek to conserve and manage natural resources. I draw from my training in oceanography, ecology and environmental economics and combine geo-spatial, econometric, and machine learning methods into my research. I also run [ERRE](https://www.erre-esp.org/), a blog about all things R and RStudio in Spanish, and help organize [EcoDataScience](http://eco-data-science.github.io/) a community of Environmental Data Science at UCSB and [beyond](https://github.com/eco-data-science/community_survey).
