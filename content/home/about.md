# Hi there!

I am a Postdoctoral scholar with the [Micheli Lab at Stanford](https://michelilab.stanford.edu/), where I study coupled human-ocean systems, with an emphasis on the design and evaluation of policy interventions that seek to conserve and manage natural resources. I draw from my training in oceanography, ecology and environmental economics and combine geo-spatial, econometric, and machine learning methods into my research, and focus my questions around Marine Protected Areas and fisheries.
