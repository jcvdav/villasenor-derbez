# Hi there!

Welcome to my site. I will soon be a Postdoctoral scholar with the [Micheli Lab](https://michelilab.stanford.edu/) at Stanford, where I will be studying climate change adaptation strategies by small-scale fishers. I study coupled human-natural systems, with an emphasis on fisheries and conservation policy. I draw from my training in ecology and environmental economics and combine geospatial, econometric, and machine learning methods to answer questions around the design and evaluation of policy interventions that seek to conserve and manage natural resources. I also run [ERRE](https://www.erre-esp.org/), a blog about all things R and RStudio in Spanish, and help organize [EcoDataScience](http://eco-data-science.github.io/) a community of Environmental Data Science at UCSB and [beyond](https://github.com/eco-data-science/community_survey).

My research is supported by the [Latin American Fisheries Fellowship Program](http://www.laff.bren.ucsb.edu), [UC MEXUS - CONACyT](https://ucmexus.ucr.edu/), [The Schmidt Environmental Fellows Program](https://ucmexus.ucr.edu/), and the [Institute on Global Conflict and Cooperation ](https://igcc.ucsd.edu/funding/who-igcc-funds/fellows.html).
