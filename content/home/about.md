# Hi there!

Welcome to my site. I am an Environmental Scientist, and I study coupled human-ocean systems, with an emphasis on the design and evaluation of policy interventions that seek to conserve and manage natural resources. I am particularly interested in how policies and ecological processes shape human incentives, and how human actions modify the marine environment. I draw from my training in oceanography, ecology and environmental economics and combine geo-spatial, econometric, and machine learning methods into my research. I just wrapped up my position as a Postdoctoral scholar with the [Micheli Lab at Stanford](https://michelilab.stanford.edu/). Later this Fall I will be joining the [Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science](https://www.earth.miami.edu/) and the [Frost Institute for Data Science & Computing](https://ficms.miami.edu/) at [UMiami](https://welcome.miami.edu/) as an Assistant Professor.

*Note*: I am in the process of revamping my website. In the meantime, you might find some broken links and outdated projects.
