# About me

I am a Ph.D. Candidate working with [Christopher Costello](https://christopherjcostello.com/) and [Steve Gaines](http://gaineslab.msi.ucsb.edu/) at the [Bren School of Environmental Science & Management](bren.ucsb.edu) in UC, Santa Barbara. I am broadly interested in the Economics of Conservation, and ask questions around the design and effectiveness of policy interventions that seek to conserve and manage natural resources. I believe today's available technology can allow us to revolutionize the way in which we design and evaluate conservation policies. My research is supported by the [Latin American Fisheries Fellowship Program](http://www.laff.bren.ucsb.edu), [UC MEXUS - CONACyT](https://ucmexus.ucr.edu/), [The Schmidt Environmental Fellows Program](https://ucmexus.ucr.edu/), and the [Institute on Global Conflict and Cooperation ](https://igcc.ucsd.edu/funding/who-igcc-funds/fellows.html).

I run [ERRE](https://www.erre-esp.org/), a blog about all things R and RStudio in Spanish, and help organize [EcoDataScience](http://eco-data-science.github.io/) a community of Environmental Data Science at UCSB and [beyond](https://github.com/eco-data-science/community_survey).
