# About me

I am a Ph.D. Candidate working with [Christopher Costello](https://christopherjcostello.com/) and [Steve Gaines](http://gaineslab.msi.ucsb.edu/) at the [Bren School of Environmental Science & Management](bren.ucsb.edu) in UC, Santa Barbara. As a [Latin American Fisheries Fellow](http://www.laff.bren.ucsb.edu) and [UC MEXUS - CONACyT](https://ucmexus.ucr.edu/), I work in Quantitative Marine Conservation and Conservation Economics. My research combines Ecological and Economic theory with Data Science. I believe today's available technology can allow us to revolutionize the way in which we design marine conservation policies. 

Along with [Camila Vargas](https://www.laff.bren.ucsb.edu/laff-network/camila-vargas) I run [ERRE](https://www.erre-esp.org/), a blog about all things R and RStudio in Spanish.
