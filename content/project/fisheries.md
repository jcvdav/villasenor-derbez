Fisheries are perhaps the most important extractive use of the oceans. They provide employment and feed millions of people around the World. From the effect of ENSO on tuna catchability to the adoption of new technologies, I am interested in how environmental variation, policy interventions, and industrialization of the oceans affect fisheries.

In ongoing work with Christopher Costello and Olivier Deschenes, we explore the effect of Mexico's distinct fuel subsidy program on fisher behavior. We leverage vessel-tracking data, administrative data on fuel subsidy allocations, and fisheries landings reports to explore the effect of the Mexican fuel subsidy program for more than 2,000 vessels.
