How do fuel subsidies in fisheries drive fishing effort? Under the textbook model of fuel subsidies, the price of all fuel is artificially reduced by the subsidy. Mexico’s subsidy program departs from the textbook model in two important and consequential ways. First, not all fishers receive the same subsidy, and the subsidy any one fisher receives typically changes from year to year. Second, he typical fisher in Mexico receives a limited quantity of subsidized fuel, and has to purchase additional fuel at the prevailing market price. Under a classical economic model, this "subsidy cap" shouldn't change marginal incentives. Yet, evidence from block-rate electricity pricing shows that people respond to “average price” (i.e. Ito, 2014). Do fishers respond to marginal or average fuel prices under a subsidy program? If fishers respond to marginal prices only, then this form of subsidy is akin to a lump-sum transfer and does not induce any additional overfishing, providing nations with a way to [reform fuel fisheries subsidies](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abm1680). If this form of subsidy in fact does induce overfishing (thriough averageing of prices), then we can estimate the effect. Chris Costello, Olivier Deschenes, and I use vessel-tracking data, administrative data on fuel subsidy allocations, and fisheries landings reports to explore the effect of the Mexican fuel subsidy program for more than 2,000 vessels.
