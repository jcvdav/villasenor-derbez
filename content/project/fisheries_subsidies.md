In ongoing work with Christopher Costello and Olivier Deschenes, we explore the effect of Mexico's peculiar fuel subsidy program on fisher behavior. We leverage vessel-tracking data, administrative data on fuel subsidy allocations, and fisheries landings reports to explore the effect of the Mexican fuel subsidy program for more than 2,000 fishing vessels.
