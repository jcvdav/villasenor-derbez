Unsustainable fishing practices threaten biodiversity, conservation, economic and social outcomes. Marine Protected Areas --and marine reserves, in which all extractive efforts are prohibited-- are frequently implemented to aid in the recovery of fish and invertebrate stocks by limiting or restricting fishing effort and gears. While widely adopted as conservation strategies, I am more interested in their utility as fishery management tools, especially when implemented as *community-based* marine reserves[^cbmr].

Theory tells us that by reducing fishing effort, populations in the bounded area should rebound. More abundant and larger organisms within the reserve should export offspring to adjacent waters; adult organisms could also step out of the invisible boundaries and step into fishing grouds. However, evidence that marine reserves can have this ecosystem-level effect that would benefit fisheries is limited. When livelihoods of fishers like the team in the picture above are at stake, it is important to base conservation and management actions on solid evidence of their effectiveness.

Through a combination of ecological and economic theory, I aim to better understand the mechanisms that govern marine reserve functioning, and provide management recommendations as to when, where, and how to implement marine reserves that meet conservation goals while producing (or maintaining) benefits to fisheries. I am also interested in understanding what are the practical implications of climate change, and how we adapt current MPA design strategies to a changing climate.

Work in progress includes:

- Reserve effectiveness:
    - Evaluating the ecological and social effectiveness of community-based marine reserves in Mexico ([working paper](https://rawgit.com/jcvdav/ReserveEffect/master/docs/paper/Villasenor-Derbez.pdf))
    - Evaluating the fishery benefits of MPAs in the Gulf of California
    - State of marine conservation in Mexico

- Predator-prey-humans:
    - How do predator-prey interactions govern the timeline of recovery and fishery benefits of in marine reserves?
    - What strategies (*e.g.* partial protection, periodical closures) maximize the benefits of marine reserves to fisheries?

- MPAs and climate change:
    - Are mobile marine protected areas (mMPAs) a better strategy to protect "species on the move"?

[^cbmr]: Community-based marine reserves are implemented by the users, typically small-scale fishers who choose to forgo profits today with the hope of increased profits tomorrow; these areas may or may not be recognized by the government.
