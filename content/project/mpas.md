Unsustainable fishing practices threaten marine biodiversity and the ecosystem benefits that it provides. Marine Protected Areas are frequently implemented to spatially control extractive activities, such as fishing. I ask questions around the design and effectiveness of spatial interventions that seek to conserve biodiversity and regulate ocean use.

In ongoing work, I explore the design features and potential cost-savings from a global market for marine conservation, lessons learned from 20 years of community-based marine conservation in Mexico, and the fisheries value of private marine reserves in Mexico.

I have become increasingly interested in the incursion and expansion of economic activities in the ocean, and seek to explore the role of *de facto* and *quasi* spatial property rights in the ocean.
