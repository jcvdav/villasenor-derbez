The Giant Sea Bass Project seeks to recover natural history of one of the appex predators in the Kelp Forests of the California Current System: the Giant Sea Bass (GSB; *Stereolepis gigas*). For a good part of the 1900Â´s, GSB were an important fishery in California. The intense fishing pressure drove down ints population to the brink of extinction, and the species was protected in 1981. However, in Baja California (Mexico) it is still allowed to fish for this species. This gives us the opportunity to obtain biological samples that further our understanding of the species.
