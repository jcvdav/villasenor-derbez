# Background

- Intended for an upper-level undergraduate class (e.g. FRE 474 by Sumeet Gulati)

--

- The use of Instrumental Variables as a quasi-experimental method for causal inference

--

- The use of this method for understanding environmental solutions, either from your own research or from other published work.

--

- Assume your “students” have a basic understanding of the method

--

- Highlight:
  - The problems with the use of ordinary least square regression while estimating the coefficient on an endogenous regressor and,
  - The conditions necessary for a valid instrument for an endogenous regressor

--

- Timeline:
  - 20 min for mock lecture
  - 5 min for clarifying questions from the class
  - 25 min for audience (search committee, LFS and IRES faculty, and students) to ask questions about your approach to teaching

---

# Endogeneity: Review

### **Endogeneity**: When a variable is determined within the system

--

Endogeneity arises:

--

- Omitted variables

--

- Measurement errors in variables

--

- Simultaneous causality

--

  - Causality runs _both ways_

--

  - Nature is full of feedbacks

--

  - Even if we observe the entire system, OLS will produce biased estimates

---
# Endogeneity: Example

## Deforestation & Malaria (MacDonald & Mordecai, 2019)

<!-- Importantly, ignoring this statistically well supported feedback leads to substantial underestimates of the true effect of deforestation on malaria transmission, which may have confounded the results of earlier studies -->

What is the effect of deforestation on malaria incidence?

```{r, echo = F, out.height=200, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("mosquito1.png")
```

--

$$
\Large{Y_i = \alpha + \beta X_i + \epsilon_i}
$$

- $Y_i$ Malaria incidence (number of Malaria cases in $i$)
- $X_i$ Deforestation (area of forest lost in $i$)

---
# Endogeneity: Example

## Deforestation & Malaria (MacDonald & Mordecai, 2019)

Bidirectional feedback between deforestation and malaria

```{r, echo = F, out.height=200, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("mosquito2.png")
```

--
> Deforestation promotes malaria via ecological mechanisms, but **local epidemics of malaria reduce forest clearing** because poor health reduces economic activity

---
# Endogeneity: Problematic

## Simultaneous causality makes $X$ endogenous

The deforestation-malaria system:

$$
\begin{split}
Y_i &= \alpha + \beta X_i + \epsilon_i \\
X_i &= \theta - \gamma Y_i + \mu_i
\end{split}
$$
--

- Imagine $\epsilon_i > 0$

--

- This increases $Y_i$

--

- A higher $Y_i$ _decreases_ $X_i$

--

- $X_i$ and $\epsilon_i$ are related

--

- An endogenous regressor biases $\hat \beta$

---
# Endogeneity: biases $\hat \beta$

Recall: $\hat{\beta} = \frac{\mathrm{cov}(Y,X)}{\mathrm{var}(X)}$

--

Let's substitute $Y_i = \alpha + \beta X_i + \epsilon_i$:

$$
\hat{\beta} = \frac{\mathrm{cov}(\alpha + \beta X + \epsilon, X)}{\mathrm{var(X)}}
$$

--

$$
\hat{\beta}= \frac{\mathrm{cov}(\alpha, X) + \beta \mathrm{cov}(X, X) + \mathrm{cov}(\epsilon, X)}{\mathrm{var(X)}}
$$
--

$$
\hat{\beta} = \frac{0 + \beta \mathrm{var}(X) + \mathrm{cov}(\epsilon, X)}{\mathrm{var(X)}}
$$

--

$$
\hat \beta= \beta + \frac{\mathrm{cov}(\epsilon, X)}{\mathrm{var(X)}}
$$

--

We need $\mathrm{cov}(\epsilon, X) = 0$, but is this true?

---
# Endogeneity: biases $\hat \beta$
Recall:
$$
\begin{align}
Y_i &= \alpha + \beta X_i + \epsilon_i \\
X_i &= \theta - \gamma Y_i + \mu_i
\end{align}
$$

Calculate $\mathrm{cov}(X,\epsilon)$:

$$
\mathrm{cov}(X, \epsilon) = \mathrm{cov}(\theta - \gamma Y + \mu, \epsilon)
$$

--

$$
\mathrm{cov}(X, \epsilon)=-\gamma\mathrm{cov}(Y,\epsilon) + \mathrm{cov}(\mu, \epsilon)
$$

--
$$
\mathrm{cov}(X, \epsilon)= -\gamma\mathrm{cov}(\alpha + \beta X + \epsilon, \epsilon)
$$

--

$$
\mathrm{cov}(X, \epsilon)= -\gamma\beta\mathrm{cov}(X,\epsilon) - \gamma\mathrm{var}(\epsilon)
$$

--

$$
\mathrm{cov}(X, \epsilon) = \frac{-\gamma\mathrm{var}(\epsilon)}{1 + \gamma\beta}
$$

--

Since $\hat \beta = \beta + \frac{\mathrm{cov}(\epsilon_i, X)}{\mathrm{var(X)}}$ and $\mathrm{cov}(X, \epsilon) \neq 0$, $\hat \beta \neq \beta$

## How do we estimate the effect of deforestation on malaria incidence?


---
# Endogeneity: Solutions

Two solutions exist:

--

- Randomized controlled experiment:

--

  - Unethical

--

  - Unfeasible

--

- Separate the exogenous part of $X$ from the endogenous part of $X$:

--

  - Imagine that we can split deforestation into an exogenous part and an endogenous part
  
$$
\begin{split}
Y_i &= \alpha + \beta X_i + \epsilon_i \\
&= \alpha + \beta \left(X_i^{\text{Exo}} + X_i^{\text{Endo}}\right) + \epsilon_i \\
&= \alpha + \beta X_i^{\text{Exo}} + \underbrace{\beta X_i^{\text{Endo}} + \epsilon_i}_{\varepsilon_i}
\end{split}
$$

--
$$
Y_i = \alpha + \beta X_i^{\text{Exo}} + \varepsilon_i
$$


--

We could use this exogenous variation in deforestation to consistently estimate $\beta$

# What does **exogenous variation** in deforestation mean, and how do we get it?

---
# Instrumental Variables

What does **exogenous variation** in deforestation mean?

--

> Changes in deforestation that are random — or at least not caused by malaria incidence

--

How do we **isolate** it?

--

>Find an instrument $Z$ that predicts $X$

--

What is an instrument?


--


An instrument is a variable that is:

- **correlated** with the explanatory variable of interest (**relevant**), _and_

--

- **uncorrelated** with the disturbance (**exogenous**)


---
# Instrumental variables

>An instrument is a variable that is:
- **correlated** with the explanatory variable of interest (**relevant**), _and_
- **uncorrelated** with the disturbance (**exogenous**)

--

With the model being:

$$
Y_i = \alpha + \beta X_i + \epsilon_i
$$

A valid instrument has to meet two necesary conditions:

--

- **Relevance:** $\mathrm{cov}(X, Z) \neq 0$ (testable)


--

- **Exogeneity:** $\mathrm{cov}(Z,\epsilon) = 0$ (not testable)


---
# Instrumental Variables


## Why must the instrument be **relevant _and_ exogenous**?

--
###  A **relevant instrument** causes changes in $X$


--
### If the **instrument is exogenous**, then part of the changes in $X$ are exogenous

--
### This exogenous variation in $X$ can be used to estimate $\beta$

---
# Instrumental Variables: Examples

**Relevance:** We need the instrument to cause a change in our endogenous explanatory variable ([Show me why](#relevance))

# Instrumental Variables: Recap


- Our instrument must be **correlated with our endogenous variable**

--


- Our instrument must be **uncorrelated with any other variable that affects the outcome**

--


- You must be able to form a cohesive story

--

## Agricultural earnings potential is a valid instrument because:

- It induces deforestation

- It is independent of malaria incidence

---

# Agricultural earnings potential is a valid instrument
## If we have a valid instrument, how do we use it?

---
# Estimation: Two-stage least squares (2SLS)

## Why is it called 2SLS?

--

It has two stages, parts, or steps:

--

- The first step uses the instrument $Z$ to decompose $X$ into:
  
  - A problematic (endogenous) component
  
  - A problem-free (**exogenous**) component
  
--
  
- The second stage

  - Uses the **exogenous** component to estimate $\beta$

---
# Estimation: 2SLS

## First stage:

$$
X_i = \pi_0 +\pi_1 Z_i + \omega_i
$$

---
# Estimation: 2SLS

## First stage:

$$
\begin{split}
X_i= \underbrace{\pi_0 +\pi_1 Z_i}_{\text{Exogenous}} + \underbrace{\omega_i}_{\text{Endogenous}}
\end{split}
$$

--

-  **Exogenous component**: The part of $X_i$ that can be predicted by $Z_i$

--

- **Endogenous component**: The part of $X_i$ that may be correlated with $\epsilon_i$

--

How do we get the exogenous part?

--

$$
\hat{X_i} = \hat{\pi_0} + \hat{\pi_1} Z_i
$$

---
# Estimation: 2SLS
## Second stage:

--

With out estimation model being:

$$
Y_i = \alpha + \beta X_i + \epsilon_i
$$

--

Replace the problematic $X_i$ with the problem-free $\hat X_i$:

--

$$
Y_i = \alpha + \beta\hat{X_i} + \epsilon_i
$$

--

Estimate $\alpha$ and $\beta$ via OLS

# Concluding remarks

The problem with the use of OLS when estimating the coefficient on an endogenous regressor and:

- It makes $\hat \beta$ a biased estimate of $\beta$

The conditions necessary for a valid instrument for an endogenous regressor:

- Relevant: $\mathrm{cov}(Z,X) \neq 0$

- Exogenous: $\mathrm{cov}(Z,\epsilon)$ is not related to any other variables in the model

# Assumption #1: Instrument relevant

---
name:exclusion
# Assumption #2: Instrument Exogeneity

Let’s assume that you have found a really great weird instrument $Z_i$ that causes land owners to deforest, but that is independent of malaria and the structural error term

With:

$$
Y_i = \alpha + \beta X_i + \epsilon_i
$$

Calculate covariance of outcome variable $Y$ and instrument $Z$:

$$
\begin{split}
\mathrm{cov}(Y,Z) &= \mathrm{cov}(\alpha + \beta X,Z)\\
&= \mathrm{cov}(\alpha,Z) + \mathrm{cov}(\beta X, Z) + \mathrm{cov}(\epsilon, Z)\\
&= 0 + \beta\mathrm{cov}(X,Z) + \mathrm{cov}(\epsilon,z)
\end{split}
$$

**Exclusion assumption**: The instrument, $Z$, only affects the outcome through changes in the endogenous variable, $X$: $\mathrm{cov}(\epsilon,z) = 0$

Then:

$$
\begin{split}
\mathrm{cov}(Y,Z) &= \beta\mathrm{cov}(X,Z)\\
\beta_{IV} &= \frac{\mathrm{cov}(Y,Z)}{\mathrm{cov}(X,Z)}
\end{split}
$$

       Y ~ e,
       D ~ A,

       exposure = "D",
       latent = "A") %>%
  ggdag(layout = "circle", stylized = F) +
  theme_void()

The data-generating process is:

$$Y = \alpha + \beta_1 D + \beta_2 A + \epsilon$$

--

---

# How real is this example?

Consider the problem faced by MacDonald et al

- $D_i$ is observable (*i.e.* purple areas imply $D_i = 1$)
- $Y_i$ is observable (*i.e.* Let's go to Mexico an do ecological surveys)
- We don't know why $D_i = 1$ for some
- We don't observe $A_i$ (*i.e.* We have no idea of the decision-making process that led owners to conserve)

---
# Endogeneity

## What does it mean to say we have an **endogenous regressor**?

Since we don't observe $A$, and our estimation model is:

$$Y = \alpha + \beta_1 D + \mu$$

With because $\mu = \beta_2 A + \epsilon$

Because $D$ is a function of $A$
